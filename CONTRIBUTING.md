# Contributions Welcome
First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository! This hackathon starter was first made to seed a hack day for Make a Wish and could be used for projects beyond that..

If you're just looking for quick feedback for an idea, proposal, or bug, feel free to open an issue.

Follow the [contribution workflow](#contribution-workflow) for submitting your changes.

## Contribution Workflow
This project uses the “fork-and-pull” development model. Follow these steps if you want to merge your changes into the project:

1. Within your fork of hackathon-starter, create a branch for your contribution and use a meaningful name.
2. Create your contribution, meeting all contribution quality standards.
3. Create a pull request against the master branch.
4. Once the pull request is approved, one of the maintainers will merge it and build a release if needed.

## Contribution Quality Standards
Your contribution needs to meet the following standards:

- Separate each logical change into its own commit.
- Add a descriptive message for each commit. Follow commit message best practices.
- Document your pull requests. Include the reasoning behind each change and the testing done.
- To the extent possible, follow existing code and documentation style and practices.
